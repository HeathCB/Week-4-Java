# Week-4-Java
My homework is in master not Master I made the same mistake as as the previous week.
The correct assignment is Homework.java  I had made some changes to the assignment then when I went to commit the changes 
I got multiple errors after trying to resolve them I ended up making a new java project and going from there.
